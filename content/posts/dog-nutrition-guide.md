# Complete Guide to Dog Nutrition and Diet

Proper nutrition is fundamental to your dog's health and longevity. This guide will help you understand your dog's nutritional needs and how to meet them.

## Essential Nutrients for Dogs

Dogs require six basic nutrient groups:

1. **Proteins**: Building blocks for cells, tissues, organs, enzymes, and hormones
2. **Fats**: Provide energy and help absorb certain vitamins
3. **Carbohydrates**: Supply energy and support gut health
4. **Vitamins**: Support various bodily functions
5. **Minerals**: Support skeletal structure and fluid balance
6. **Water**: Critical for nearly all biological processes

## Choosing the Right Food

When selecting dog food, consider:

### Commercial Dog Food Types

- **Dry kibble**: Convenient, helps clean teeth, economical
- **Wet food**: Higher moisture content, more palatable, often more expensive
- **Semi-moist food**: Convenient but often contains more preservatives
- **Freeze-dried/dehydrated**: Minimal processing, nutrient-dense

### Reading Labels

Look for:
- Named protein sources (e.g., "chicken" not "meat by-products")
- No artificial colors, flavors, or preservatives
- AAFCO statement indicating complete and balanced nutrition

## Feeding by Life Stage

### Puppies
- Need more calories per pound than adult dogs
- Require food specifically formulated for growth
- Should be fed 3-4 times daily until 6 months old

### Adult Dogs
- Typically fed twice daily
- Caloric needs depend on size, breed, activity level
- May need different formulations based on activity level

### Senior Dogs
- Often need fewer calories but higher quality protein
- May benefit from supplements for joint health
- Might need more easily digestible foods

## Common Dietary Issues

### Food Allergies
Signs include:
- Itchy skin
- Ear infections
- Gastrointestinal problems

### Obesity
Prevention and management:
- Measure food portions
- Limit treats to 10% of daily calories
- Regular exercise
- Regular weight checks

## Homemade and Raw Diets

If considering homemade or raw diets:
- Consult with a veterinary nutritionist
- Ensure balanced nutrition
- Be aware of food safety concerns
- Transition gradually

Remember that every dog is an individual with unique nutritional needs. What works for one dog may not work for another. Always consult with your veterinarian before making significant changes to your dog's diet.
